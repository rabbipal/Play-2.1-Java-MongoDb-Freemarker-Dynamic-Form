First steps with Playframework and MongoDb 
-------------------------------------------

This app was started as a test for Play 2.0 to attempt dynamic loading of static pages so that we could create new reports without having to stop/start the server. 
It was a proof of concept and is very basic. My thanks to guillaumebort for his freemarker demo, as well as Mironor for his MongoDB demo.

* Don't forget to start mongodb daemon - mongod! It should use the default host (localhost) and the default port.

* Run the application in dev mode ("play run", CTRL D to end)

* Run the application in prod mode ("play start", STOP to end - its a bat file)

* Give your template a name, copy and paste your html or ftl template into the htmlText and click create. 

* Click view for your template. It will be dynamically loaded.
